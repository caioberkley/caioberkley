# It´s "a me", Caio!

I'm a mobile developer with over 8 years of professional experience, approximately 6 years focused on iOS ObjC/Swift/SwiftUI, and brief experiences in other languages such as Kotlin, Java, React Native, and Flutter.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling (especially to the interior of the Northeast of Brazil, where I was born), exploring new places/cultures, and spending time with my boyfriend, friends, and family.

My experience includes working at renowned companies (Meta, Santander, Natura, Itaú Unibanco, and Webmotors), where I honed my skills by working on challenging projects and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I was responsible for implementing features, making solution decisions, and contributing to the continuous improvement of the applications.
