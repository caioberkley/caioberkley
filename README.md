# It´s "a me", Caio!

I'm a mobile developer with over 9 years of professional experience, approximately 7 years focused on iOS (Objective-C, Swift, and SwiftUI), and brief experiences in other technologies such as Android (Java and Kotlin) and frameworks for hybrid development (React Native and Flutter).

My experience includes working at renowned companies (Pinterest, Meta, Santander, Natura, Itaú, and Webmotors), where I honed my skills by working on challenging projects and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I was responsible for implementing features, making solution decisions, and contributing to the continuous improvement of the applications.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling (especially to the interior of the Northeast of Brazil, where I was born), exploring new places/cultures, and spending time with my boyfriend, friends, and family.
